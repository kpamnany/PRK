NAME:    Pipeline

PURPOSE: This program tests the efficiency with which point-to-point
         synchronization can be carried out. It does so by executing 
         a pipelined algorithm on an m*n grid. The first array dimension
         is distributed among the threads (stripwise decomposition).
  
USAGE:   The program takes as input the
         dimensions of the grid, and the number of iterations on the grid

               <progname> <iterations> <m> <n>
  
         The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the 
         algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.

FUNCTIONS CALLED:

         Other than standard C functions, the following 
         functions are used in this program:

         wtime()
